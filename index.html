       <img src="https://flic.kr/p/XzNPtZ" alt="Tyler Stephens">
    <p>Born and raised in Orlando, I grew up working in the service industry since I was 16. 
        I've worked for Universal Orlando for over 7 years getting experience in sales, attractions, and entertainment. 
        I've also worked other jobs on the side such as a personal trainer with LA Fitness.
        I've recently started studying full stack web development through UCF and will persue a career in this field upon graduation.
